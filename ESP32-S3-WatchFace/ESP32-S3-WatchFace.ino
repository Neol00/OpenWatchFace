 * FPS) — parallel rendering finished early and then waited on it (idle cores).
 *
 * PARTIAL mode renders into small line-buffers and flushes ONLY the dirty rectangle
 * LVGL computed (my_disp_flush gets `area`). A moving clock hand / scrolling list now
 * pushes a small region instead of the whole screen, so present cost collapses. The
 * buffers are small enough to live in fast INTERNAL SRAM (the other half of the win:
 * no slow PSRAM read per push), and we use TWO so LVGL can render the next tile while
 * the previous one is being sent. Leave DIRECT_RENDER_MODE undefined.
 *
 * SIZING: only ~80KB internal SRAM is free TOTAL (the About page's "free" and "max
 * block" are two views of the SAME pool, not two separate 80KB pools). So BOTH buffers
 * must share that ~80KB. At 40 lines each: 374w * 40 * 2B = ~30KB per buffer, ~60KB for
 * the pair, leaving ~20KB SRAM headroom. Smaller tiles => more flush calls per frame,
 * but each is a fast SRAM->QSPI partial push — still far cheaper than the old fullscreen
