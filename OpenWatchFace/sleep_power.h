 *  sleep_power.h — deep sleep + the AXP2101 peripheral-rail safety probe.
 *
 *  Everything around powering the watch down and back up:
 *    - the runtime per-rail safety probe (which AXP2101 LDOs can be cut in sleep
 *      without deadlocking the I2C bus / losing the RTC), its NVS journal, and the
 *      Power-screen accessors (rail_* — forward-declared in the .ino for app_power.h);
 *    - rails_restore() (boot) / rails_cut_for_sleep() (pre-sleep);
 *    - the one-shot SD-rail diagnostic (guarded by SD_RAIL_DIAG, default 0);
 *    - the deep-sleep entry paths (enter_deep_sleep / arm_wakes_and_sleep /
 *      rearm_and_deep_sleep) and the light background-check path
 *      (background_check_has_new) that a timer wake runs without the display.
 *
 *  Header-only; compiled into the .ino TU. INCLUDE AFTER:
 *    - the hardware objects (board_power.h, gfx, rtc, Wire, USBSerial) and the
 *      config macros (BOOT_BTN_GPIO, SLEEP_INTENT_MAGIC, rtc_sleep_intent,
 *      IIC_SDA/SCL) defined at the top of the .ino;
 *    - settings_store.h (s_checks_enabled, s_check_interval_min via watch_base.h),
 *      timer_store.h, haptics.h, power_model.h (calib_note_*), ble_provision.h
 *      (ble_end), sd_card.h (SDMMC pins) and notif_net.h (notif_fetch_raw,
 *      rtc_last_notif_id) — all the things the sleep paths call.
 *  The .ino forward-declares the rail_* accessors (for app_power.h, included
 *  earlier); this header defines them.
 *
 *  NOTE: rounder_event_cb (the CO5300 even-alignment LVGL callback) deliberately
 *  does NOT live here — it's a display callback and stays with my_disp_flush /
 *  my_touchpad_read in the .ino.

/* ===================== runtime peripheral-rail safety probe ==================
 * We can't trust the schematic for which AXP2101 rail powers what, and the ONE
 * rail we must never cut is whichever feeds the shared I2C pull-ups (cutting it
 * deadlocks the wake — you can't re-enable a rail over the bus it powers). So the
 * watch probes each candidate rail at runtime: disable it, check the PMU + RTC
 * still ACK on I2C, then re-enable. Rails that pass are marked SAFE — meaning
 * "won't deadlock the wake" — but that is NOT enough on its own: a rail can pass
 * the I2C test yet still power the DISPLAY, so cutting it leaves a blank screen on
 * wake. So actually cutting a rail is OPT-IN PER RAIL (s_rail_cut, default OFF):
 * you enable SAFE rails one at a time from Settings>Power and confirm the screen
 * comes back after a real sleep/wake. Nothing is cut until you say so.
 *
 * Crash-safe probe: the rail being probed is journaled to NVS *before* it's
 * disabled, so if a probe freezes the bus, the next boot (after a cold power-cycle
 * restores defaults) sees the journal and marks that rail UNSAFE. Only peripheral
 * LDOs are candidates — never DCDC1 (ESP32) or the RTC supply.
 *
 * Recovery if you enable a bad rail (blank on wake): cold power-cycle (PWR off,
 * then on) -> the screen works again -> turn on Caffeine (so it won't sleep) ->
 * Settings>Power -> toggle that rail back off. */
